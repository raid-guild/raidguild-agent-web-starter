# Full-Stack Agent Starter

This repo is a minimal Next.js template for the Pinata Agents hosting platform, adapted into a small full-stack tutorial starter.

It gives you:

- a valid `manifest.json` with one public hosted route
- a Next.js app mounted at `/app`
- a SQLite-backed todo example using App Router API routes
- a workspace-served avatar asset exposed through the API
- a PM2-managed runtime so the hosted app can restart without turning the agent into its own watchdog
- a `workspace/` folder with the basic identity and behavior docs you can customize

## What to customize

- `manifest.json`: change the name, description, slug, tags, secrets, and routes
- `workspace/IDENTITY.md`: define what the agent is called and how it presents itself
- `workspace/SOUL.md`: define tone, principles, and operating style
- `app/`: replace the tutorial UI and routes
- `workspace/assets/`: replace the starter avatar or add more served assets

## Project structure

- `manifest.json` defines the Pinata agent metadata, lifecycle scripts, and `/app` route
- `app/` contains the App Router UI plus `app/api/*` route handlers
- `lib/todos.js` manages a small SQLite file at `workspace/data/todos.db`
- `server.js` runs a tiny custom Next server and exposes a health endpoint
- `ecosystem.config.cjs` tells PM2 how to run the app
- `workspace/` holds the editable agent instructions modeled after the Pinata example

## Tutorial routes

- `GET /app/api/todos`
- `POST /app/api/todos`
- `PATCH /app/api/todos/:id`
- `DELETE /app/api/todos/:id`
- `GET /app/api/avatar`

## First-run operator prompt

Use something like this when you first open the agent:

```text
This is a starter for building small hosted agent apps. I want you to act like a practical builder, not a generic assistant.

First, tell me what is already included in this template.
Then give me 3 focused app directions that fit this stack well.
For each direction, explain the landing page, the core API routes, and the persistent data model.
Then recommend one as the best narrow v1 and start implementing it.
```

Good starter directions for this template include:

- workout assistant
- kitchen aide
- study coach
- travel planner
- creator studio helper
- household ops helper

## Local usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/app`.

If you need a different local port:

```bash
PORT=3011 npm run build && PORT=3011 npm start
```

For local daemon mode:

```bash
PORT=3011 npm run start:daemon
```

## Pinata hosting notes

The manifest is configured so Pinata can:

- install dependencies and run `next build`
- run `npm start` on agent boot through `pm2-runtime`
- expose port `3000` at `/app`

If you replace the tutorial with another frontend or API shape, keep the server bound to `0.0.0.0` and make sure it can serve behind the `/app` path prefix.
